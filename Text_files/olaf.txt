I'm just living the dream Anna. Oh, how I wish this could last forever.
And yet change mocks us with her beauty...
Forgive me, maturity is making me poetic. Tell me, you're older and thus all-knowing. Do you ever worry about the notion that, nothing is permanent?
Really? Wow, I can't wait till I'm aged like you, so I don't have to worry about important things.
Grizzly bear!
Mama bear!
Papa bear!
Hans!
We didn't even kiss you! 
We all correctly got it.
Okay.  Lightning round, boys against girls. Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready.
Polar Bear!
Sorry.
Yeah, I'm tired too, and Sven promised to read me a bedtime story, didn't you Sven?
Oh you do the best voices like when you pretend to be Kristoff and you're like "I'll just go talk to some rocks about my childhood and stuff..."
Oh no, I'm gonna blow!
Oh yeah. We're calling this, "controlling what you can when things feel out of control".
I'll bring the snacks!
Who wants a trivia? I am, okay!
Yeah, that's not true.
Hmm, well, that was unanimous. But I will look it up when we get home.
Did you know that the Enchanted Forest is a place of transformation? I have no idea what that means, but I can't wait to see what it's gonna do to each one of us.
Umm, Anna? Elsa? Sven? Samantha?  I don't even know who's Samantha!  That's normal... 
Whoa
Hey guys, meet the wind spirit!
I'll hold your hands, but I can't find my arms!
Oh, my theory about advanced technology is both our savior and our doom?
The one about cucumbers?
Oh, yeah. Water has memory. The water that makes up you and me has passed through at least 4 humans and or animals before us.  And remembers everything.  The wind's back! I think I'll name you Gale.
Who is she?
I got this. Hi! I'm Olaf.  Oh, sorry, yeah, I just find clothes restricting. Bet you're wondering who we are and why we are here. It's really quite simple.  It began with two sisters. One born with magical powers, and one born powerless. Their love of snowmen, infinite. "Anna, No! Too high!" Blast! "Ow, Mama, Papa, help!" Slam! Doors shutting everywhere, sisters torn apart! Well, at least they have their parents. Their parents are dead. "Oh, I am Anna, I wanna marry a man I just met!" Elsa's gonna blow, snow, snow, ah run! Magic pulses through my snowflakes.  I live! "Ice palace for one, ice palace for one!" "Get out Anna!"  "My heart!"
I think they got it.
This will all makes sense when I'm older...
Brilliant! It's so refreshing to talk to the youth of today. Our future is in bright hands--
Oh no, no, no. Don't chew that, you don't know what I've stepped there
This is why we don't play with fire. Ah, I can't stay mad at you, you're so cute!
Hey guys, that was close!
Oh yeah, I think they took off with that Ryder guy and a bunch of reindeer.
Who knows the ways of men.
Anna, Elsa Kristoff and Sven You all came back! I love a happy ending! I mean I presume we're done Or is this putting us in more dangerous situation gonna be, a regular thing?
Show yourself!! RIGHT NOW!  Elsa, be who you are.  Oh I will Mama, I will!  Elsa's DEAD. Olaf's DEAD. Anna cries...  And then a bunch of important things happen that I forgot but all that matters is I was right and water has memory and thus...  I LIVE. And so do you.
Yeah! It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse. How about yellow?  No, not yellow. Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go!  Am I right?  Hi!
Please, don't drop me. 
Alright, we got off to a bad start.
Wait. What am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
Oh! Thank you!
Now I'm perfect.
It was like my whole life got upside down.  Wooh!
Head rush!
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose.  So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.  What? Hey! Woh!  Oh, I love it even more! Hah. Alright, let's start this thing over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs. 
And you are?
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?
Oh! They're...oh, okay. Makes things easier for me.  Ha! Aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose.  I like you, too!
Yeah. Why? 
Yeah. Why?
Yeah. Why?
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.  Yeah, Why?
Summer?
Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.
Nope! But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.  Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow a dandelion fuzz. And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.  A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand. Probably getting gorgeously tanned in summer.  I'll finally see a summer breeze blow away a winter storm, and find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm.  And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me. Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer!  Da-da...da-doo. Ah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-booh.  The hot and the cold are both so intense. Put 'em together, it just makes sense!  Rat-da-dat-dad-dada-dada-doo.  Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle, but put me in summer and I'll be a...  Happy snowman!  When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam. Oh, the sky will be blue.  And you guys will be there too. When I finally do what frozen things do in summer! 
In summer!  So, come on! Elsa's this way.  Let's go bring back summer!
Yeah. I bet she's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever.  Oh, look at that. I've been impaled.  
Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.
Knock. Just knock.  Why isn't she knocking? Do you think she knows how to knock? 
Bye, Sven. 
Me?
Okay.  One...two...three...four...  
Fifty-eight...fifty-nine...sixty.
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs! 
You built me. Remember that?
Um...I think so? 
Heads up!  Watch out for my butt!  
I'll distract him. You guys go.  No, no! Not you guys!  This just got a whole lot harder. 
Man, am I out of shape!  There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where'd you guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there!  Hey. We were just talking about you.  All good things, all good things.  No!  This is not making much of a difference, is it? 
Hang in there, guys! 
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs! 
Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.  Oh, that feels better.  Hey, Sven! He found us.  Who's my cute little reindeer? 
I don't have a skull...or bones. 
You hesitated.
Okay! Where are we going?
I like to consider myself a love expert.
Look, Sven. The sky's awake. 
He's crazy. 
I'll distract them while you run.  Hi, Sven's family!  It's nice to meet you!  Because I love, Anna, I insist you run.  I understand you're love experts! Wooh.  Why aren't you running?
Kristoff's home! Wait. Kristoff? 
The only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is...
I'm coming!  Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!
I'll meet you guys at the castle!
I will!  Hello!
Anna! Oh, no. 
Whoa! So this is heat. I love it.  Ooh! But don't touch it!  So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?
But we ran all the way here?
I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you.  Do you happen to have any ideas?
That's okay, I do. Love is putting someone else's needs before yours. Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever. 
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you? 
Some people are worth melting for.  Just maybe not right this second!  Don't worry, I've got it!  We're going to get through...  Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something.  It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way.
Wow, he's really moving fast. I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.
No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.
Why?  Oh, I know why! There's your act of true love right there! Riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!  Come on!  Look out!  Uh...back this way!  We're trapped.   Slide, Anna!  We made it! 
Keep going! 
Anna?  
An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last. 
Summer!  Ooh. Hello.  
Hey, guys.
Glide and pivot and glide and pivot...
